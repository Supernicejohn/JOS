# JOS
This is me learning as I go along, and should not be seen as an alternative to CraftOS, unlike other CC OS'es. This 'OS' will have the features listed below, but may implement them in such a way that cross-compatibility with the default CraftOS can not be guaranteed for 3rd party programs. 
There will be proper explanations for everything and reasoning behind certain choices once the OS is in a working state.

Development of new CC OS

Planned:
Full multitasking
File permissions per-process
Custom periheral handling
Built-in programs (text/code editor, paint tool, file browser, etc)
Customizable theme and palette.
