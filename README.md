# JOS
This is a reimagining of some past projects for a ComputerCraft OS, and the project is in its early stages of development
First working part of the windowmanager and event manager for the OS, also first upload to github

# Language
This project is 100% Lua, with config and initialization-files in a custom format. 
The file extentions of those makes github think I program in D and ABL, which is mildly amusing :)
All system files have the extention '.sys' instead of '.lua'
